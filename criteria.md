Domain Background

Student briefly details background information of the domain from which the project is proposed. Historical information relevant to the project should be included. It should be clear how or why a problem in the domain can or should be solved. Related academic research should be appropriately cited. A discussion of the student's personal motivation for investigating a particular problem in the domain is encouraged but not required.

Problem Statement

Student clearly describes the problem that is to be solved. The problem is well defined and has at least one relevant potential solution. Additionally, the problem is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable.

Datasets and Inputs

The dataset(s) and/or input(s) to be used in the project are thoroughly described. Information such as how the dataset or input is (was) obtained, and the characteristics of the dataset or input, should be included. It should be clear how the dataset(s) or input(s) will be used in the project and whether their use is appropriate given the context of the problem.

Solution Statement

Student clearly describes a solution to the problem. The solution is applicable to the project domain and appropriate for the dataset(s) or input(s) given. Additionally, the solution is quantifiable, measurable, and replicable.

Benchmark Model

A benchmark model is provided that relates to the domain, problem statement, and intended solution. Ideally, the student's benchmark model provides context for existing methods or known information in the domain and problem given, which can then be objectively compared to the student's solution. The benchmark model is clearly defined and measurable.

Evaluation Metrics

Student proposes at least one evaluation metric that can be used to quantify the performance of both the benchmark model and the solution model presented. The evaluation metric(s) proposed are appropriate given the context of the data, the problem statement, and the intended solution.

Project Design

Student summarizes a theoretical workflow for approaching a solution given the problem. Discussion is made as to what strategies may be employed, what analysis of the data might be required, or which algorithms will be considered. The workflow and discussion provided align with the qualities of the project. Small visualizations, pseudocode, or diagrams are encouraged but not required.

Presentation

Proposal follows a well-organized structure and would be readily understood by its intended audience. Each section is written in a clear, concise and specific manner. Few grammatical and spelling mistakes are present. All resources used and referenced are properly cited.

Software Requirements

Given the free-form nature of the machine learning capstone, the software and libraries you will need to successfully complete your work will vary depending on the chosen application area and problem definition. Because of this, it is imperative that all necessary software and libraries you consider using in your capstone project are accessible clearly documented. Please note that proprietary software, software that requires private licenses, or software behind a paywall or login account should be avoided.

Data Requirements

Every machine learning capstone project will most certainly require some form of dataset or input data structure (input text files, images, etc.). Similar to the software requirements above, the data you are considering must either be publicly accessible or provided by you during the submission process, and private or proprietary data should not be used without expressed permission. Please take into consideration the file size of your data â€” while there is no strict upper limit, input files that are excessively large may require reviewers longer than an acceptable amount of time to acquire all of your project files. This can take away from the reviewer's time that could be put towards evaluating your proposal. If the data you are considering fits the criteria of being too large, consider whether you could work with a subset of the data instead, or provide a representative sample of the data.

Ethics

Udacity's A/B Testing course, as part of the Data Analyst Nanodegree, has a segment that discusses the sensitivity of data and the expectation of privacy from those whose information has been collected. While most data you find available to the public will not have any ethical complications, it is extremely important that you are considering where the data you are using came from, and whether that data contains any sensitive information. For example, if you worked for a bank and wanted to use customers' bank statements as part of your project, this would most likely be an unethical choice of data and should be avoided.

If you have any questions regarding the nature of a dataset or software you intend to use for the capstone project, please send an email to machine-support@udacity.com with the subject "Capstone Project Dataset/Software Inquiry".


Report Guidelines
Your project submission will be evaluated on the written proposal that is submitted. Additionally, depending on the project you are proposing, other materials such as the data being used will be evaluated. It is expected that the proposal contains enough detail, documentation, analysis, and discussion to adequately reflect the work you intend to complete for the project. Because of this, it is extremely important that the proposal is written in a professional, standardized way, so those who review your project's proposal are able to clearly identify each component of your project in the report. Without a properly written proposal, your project cannot be sufficiently evaluated. A project proposal template is provided for you to understand how a project proposal should be structured. We strongly encourage students to have a proposal that is approximately two to three pages in length.

The Machine Learning Capstone Project proposal should be treated no different than a written research paper for academics. Your goal is to ultimately present the research you've discovered into the respective problem domain you've chosen, and then clearly articulate your intended project to your peers. The narrative found in the project proposal template provides for a "proposal checklist" that will aid you in fully completing a documented proposal. Please make use of this resource!


Submitting the Project
Evaluation
Your project will be reviewed by a Udacity reviewer against the Capstone Project Proposal rubric. Be sure to review this rubric thoroughly and self-evaluate your project before submission. All criteria found in the rubric must be meeting specifications for you to pass.

Submission Files
At minimum, your submission will be required to have the following files listed below. If your submission method of choice is uploading an archive `(*.zip )`, please take into consideration the total file size. You will need to include

A project proposal, in PDF format only, with the name proposal.pdf, addressing each of the seven key points of a proposal. The recommended page length for a proposal is approximately two to three pages.
Any additional supporting material such as datasets, images, or input files that are necessary for your project and proposal. If these files are too large and you are uploading your submission, instead provide appropriate means of acquiring the necessary files in an included README.md file.
Once you have collected these files and reviewed the project rubric, proceed to the project submission page.
